## 0x00. AirBnB clone

The goal of this project is to deploy a simple copy of AirBnB website on server.
After 4 months, we will have a complete web application composed by:

+ A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
+ A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
+ A database or files that store data (data = objects)
+ An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
